    <meta name="description" content="Tempo Stack is an HTML5-based game where players control a moving block, with the objective of stacking each new block on top of the previous one. The block moves back and forth between two walls, changing directions when it hits a wall. Players must time their actions to stop the block at the right moment, aligning it precisely on top of the stack.">
